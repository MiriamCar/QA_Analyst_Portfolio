#### Happy testing! 🔎🐞

## My Projects

#### :mailbox: Postman REST API Testing
+ CRUD operations for API requests using available APIs from (1) My Store API - https://mystoreapi.com/ and (2) Swagger Pet Store - https://petstore.swagger.io/

This collections provide basic operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data using the APIs, as well as automated positive and negative tests to verify the functionality of these APIs.

> In this button you can access the collections of CRUD operations

+ Multiples assertions

This collection provides automated testing with dynamic data generation, tests to validate response elements in the header, assert non-null values and specific value types, and conduct API testing with response arrays, along with multiple assertions. This comprehensive set of tests ensures the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the APIs under examination.
