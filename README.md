# Hi! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Miriam

### A passionate QA Analyst from Argentina! ðŸ§‰ 

**Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!**

In this portfolio, I will be sharing the tasks and assignments that I have completed as part of my learning and mastery of some of the most useful tools for QA testers. I have always been interested in technology, and I have been actively seeking to enhance my skills in this field by learning and exploring various tools and techniques.

In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work with some of the most popular QA testing tools, including:

- Selenium IDE

- JMeter

- Postman

- Cypress

- SQL

Each project in this portfolio represents a different aspect of my journey as a QA analyst, and I hope that you find them informative and helpful.

I'm also working on some basic tutorials for those who wish to enter the exciting world of Software Testing! ðŸš€

Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
